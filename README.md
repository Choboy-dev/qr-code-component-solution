# QR Code Component Project

## Overview

This project is a QR code component designed to improve my front-end skills and test my HTML and CSS knowledge. It allows users to scan a QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take their coding skills to the next level.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts (Nunito Sans)

## How I Built This Project

### HTML Structure

The project's HTML structure is quite straightforward. It consists of a single HTML file containing the following key components:

- **`<div class="white-container">`**: This container holds all the content and is styled as a white box in the center of the page.

- **`<div class="image-container">`**: Within the `.white-container`, there's an image container for displaying the QR code image.

- **`<div class="paragraph-one">`** and **`<div class="paragraph-two">`**: These containers hold the project's main messages.

### CSS Styling

To style the project, I used CSS to define the following key aspects:

- **Box Sizing**: I applied `box-sizing: border-box;` to ensure consistent box-sizing for all elements.

- **Body Styles**: I reset the margin and padding on the `body` element and set a background color. I also applied the Nunito Sans font for the entire project.

- **Container Styles**: The `.white-container` was given a fixed width and height, and a white background to create a clean container for the content.

- **Image Styling**: I adjusted the dimensions of the QR code image within the `.white-container`.

- **Flexbox for Centering**: To center the `.white-container` on the page both horizontally and vertically, I used flexbox by applying `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;` to the `body`. This ensures a responsive centering of the content.

## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- Structuring HTML for a simple web component.
- Applying CSS for styling and layout.
- Using Google Fonts to enhance typography.
- Centering content both horizontally and vertically with CSS flexbox.

This project helped me solidify my front-end development skills and provided a practical opportunity to apply what I've learned.
